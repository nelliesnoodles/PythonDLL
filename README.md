A python double linked list and it's pytest file

As I'm writing blog posts and updating the old code, I've found that I should really have this stored in an extra location. 
Feel free to use this code if you are experimenting with data structures and wish to see the double linked list in action. 

If you decide to tinker with swaping, or changing pointers/ (the next and previous of the node) be prepared to use your Ctrl^c in case an infinite loop occurs. I've done it plenty, and it's easy to accidently do. 

Some methods have been totally updated from the previous version found on my old blog,  CamelCaseNoodles.
